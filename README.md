Personalized Navigation Application


Welcome to the Personalized Navigation Application! This application is designed to provide users with personalized routes based on their preferences while taking into account obstacles in public spaces. Whether you're navigating through a crowded city or exploring a new area, this app aims to make your journey as smooth and efficient as possible.

Features
Tailored Algorithm: The application features a sophisticated algorithm that generates personalized routes based on user preferences. Whether you prefer the fastest route, the most scenic path, or the least crowded option, the algorithm adjusts the route accordingly.

Obstacle Consideration: Our algorithm takes into consideration obstacles in public spaces, such as construction sites, road closures, or crowded areas, ensuring that users are directed around such obstacles to minimize disruptions during their journey.

Node.js: Used for server-side development, providing a scalable and efficient runtime environment.
React Native: Employed for building the mobile application, enabling cross-platform compatibility and a native user experience.
MongoDB: Utilized for data storage, ensuring reliable and flexible storage of user preferences and route data.
Express.js: Used as the web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the development of robust APIs and backend services.
Swagger UI: Integrated for API documentation, providing a user-friendly interface for developers to explore and test the application's endpoints.
Jira: Utilized for project management and issue tracking, enabling efficient collaboration and task management throughout the development process.
